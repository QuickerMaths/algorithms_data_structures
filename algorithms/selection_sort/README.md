# Selection Sort Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements the **Selection Sort** algorithm, a simple comparison-based sorting technique.

## How It Works

1. **Find the smallest element** in the unsorted portion of the array.
2. **Swap** it with the element at the current index (`i`).
3. **Move to the next index** and repeat the process until the array is fully sorted.

**Time complexity:** O(n^2)

**Space complexity:** O(1)
